Learning Project: Django REST, Docker, Kubernetes
This project is part of my learning journey with Django REST Framework, Docker, and Kubernetes. The API REST is based on a tutorial I found on YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE0Q8YNKNgs and I'm using this repository to follow along with the tutorial step-by-step, as well as to experiment and deepen my understanding of these topics.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to learn how to develop a web application using Django REST Framework for the backend, Docker for containerizing the application, and Kubernetes for container orchestration. Through this project, I hope to gain hands-on experience of how each technology works individually and how they integrate together in a real development environment.


Project Structure

/projects: this is an aplicacion
/docker: Here you'll find Docker-related files such as the Dockerfile and configuration files needed for building and running containers.
/kubernetes: Contains Kubernetes configuration files for container orchestration in a Kubernetes cluster.
